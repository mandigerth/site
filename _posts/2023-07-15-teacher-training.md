## Teacher Training

Mandi Gerth provides teacher training on classical pedagogy, how to teach great books, and creating classroom culture. She also speaks at classical educational conferences.

## What teachers have to say...

> I am convinced that a classical Christian education is the best education I can give my students, but I do not yet have all the practical knowledge about what a day in the life at a classical school actually looks like. I really enjoyed your talk and feel inspired to start incorporating prayer, songs, poetry, and read alouds into the classroom routine.

-Catherine Root

> I attended your session on Creating Classroom Culture.  I came away with lots of little tidbits that will make my heart and my teaching line up with Classical Christian Education in more meaningful ways.  Thank you for being willing to share with all of us.

-Barbara Kilkenny

> It stood out among all the others as being the most inspiring and beneficial to me! Bravo! You did such a wonderful job communicating how you have created culture in your classroom.
